# ðŸ“Œ Advanced Python Learning Roadmap (Step-by-Step)

## Week 1 â€“ Core Advanced Functions & Decorators

- **Day 1:** Closures & Decorators (âœ… you started today)  
- **Day 2:** Function arguments deep dive (*args, **kwargs, unpacking tricks)  
- **Day 3:** Higher-order functions & functools (caching with lru_cache, partial functions)  
- **Day 4:** Iterators & Generators (yield, generator pipelines)  
- **Day 5:** Context Managers (with statement, custom __enter__/__exit__)  
- **Day 6:** Advanced error handling & custom exceptions  
- **Day 7 (Project):** Logging & Resource Manager  
  â†’ Build a system that times, logs, and manages resources (files/db connections) using decorators + context managers.

## Week 2 â€“ OOP & Design Patterns

- **Day 8:** OOP recap (dunder methods, __str__, __repr__, immutability tricks)  
- **Day 9:** Class methods vs static methods, property decorators  
- **Day 10:** Abstract Base Classes & Interfaces  
- **Day 11:** Multiple inheritance & Mixins  
- **Day 12:** OOP Design Patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer in Python)  
- **Day 13:** Dataclasses & NamedTuples (when to use them)  
- **Day 14 (Project):** Plugin System  
  â†’ Build a plugin-based app where new features can be added dynamically using OOP patterns.

## Week 3 â€“ Concurrency & Parallelism

- **Day 15:** Multithreading in Python (GIL, ThreadPool)  
- **Day 16:** Multiprocessing (CPU-bound tasks)  
- **Day 17:** Asyncio (async/await, event loop)  
- **Day 18:** Combining threads, processes, async  
- **Day 19:** Queues, Executors, Job scheduling  
- **Day 20:** Advanced concurrency patterns (rate limiting, retries, backpressure)  
- **Day 21 (Project):** Web Scraper with Concurrency  
  â†’ Scrape 100+ pages fast using async/threads + retry logic.

## Week 4 â€“ Advanced Data Handling

- **Day 22:** File handling deep dive (large files, memory-efficient reads)  
- **Day 23:** JSON, YAML, Pickle, serialization best practices  
- **Day 24:** CSV, Excel, Parquet handling with pandas  
- **Day 25:** Regex deep dive (practical text parsing)  
- **Day 26:** DateTime tricks & timezones  
- **Day 27:** Memory optimization (sys, gc, __slots__)  
- **Day 28 (Project):** Data ETL Pipeline  
  â†’ Extract data (CSV/JSON), transform it, and load into a structured format with logging + validation.

## Week 5 â€“ Python for APIs & System Design

- **Day 29:** Virtual environments & project structure  
- **Day 30:** Packaging, imports, __init__.py
