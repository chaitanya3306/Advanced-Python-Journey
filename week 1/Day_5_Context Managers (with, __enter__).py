# ðŸ“˜ Day 5: Context Managers (with, __enter__/__exit__, contextlib)
# ------------------------------------------------------
# Read + run these examples. They are production-style and commented.

"""
WHY CONTEXT MANAGERS?
- Ensure setup/cleanup around a code block.
- Cleanup runs even if errors happen.
- Use `with ... as ...:` to acquire a resource and release it safely.

# --- Built-in example: files ---
with open("example.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write("Hello from Day 5!\n")

# --- Function-style with contextlib.contextmanager ---

# --- Handy helpers: suppress, closing, ExitStack ---
from contextlib import suppress, closing, ExitStack
import urllib.request

# closing: for objects that need close() but lack __enter__/__exit__
# (Commented to avoid network in some environments)
# with closing(urllib.request.urlopen("https://example.com")) as resp:
#     _ = resp.read(50)

# ExitStack: dynamic number of contexts

# Timer context: measure block duration

# --- Most Important to Remember ---
"""
1) Context managers guarantee cleanup (use `with`).
2) Class-based: implement __enter__ (setup) and __exit__ (cleanup).
3) __exit__ return True to suppress errors; False/None to re-raise.
4) Function-based: use @contextmanager with try/finally.
5) Tools: contextlib.suppress, closing, ExitStack for dynamic/nested resources.
6) Common use cases: files, locks, DB connections, timing, temp dirs/settings.
